# JSON-TO-DATABASE

Moto:
1)Creating database using key-value path of a JSON data . 
2)Inserting the same JSON data into the database tables.

About the project:
1) data_example is the sample file consisting about 300 rows which was extracted by webScraping.
2) After analying the data which was done in previous project : https://github.com/hargunYashkumar/yash_saasKart.git , we have created a databse which is saas-schema.sql
3) Now we will insert the same rows of json int o the databse and foe which the script is all_in_one.py
4) all_in_one.py script also helps to change datatype and clean it to insert it int o the schema.

Optional:
1) There are two files ,one for convering the json data (StructureIdle.py) which will be inserted into databse in (FinalSql_idle.py). 
2) all_in_one.py consist both the files scrpt . in a single run the data will be manipulated and inserted into Database.
